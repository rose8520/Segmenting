%% Note that these were made to work using Australian coins and notes. Other foreign currencies are required
   to be explored. %%

1. rosie_houghcircles requires the toolbox Kinectmex to capture images. I have placed a sample image here for 
testing.

2. This coding has yet to be robust as the values of the plate and coins radius has to be altered using the 
imtool function to manually measure the plate and coins in pixels.

3. The SIFT coding on the lowest part of the script can be uncommented to allow SIFT to work.

4. SIFT coding has to be improved as for now it is only able to detect that there is a note within the plate but
not able to distinguish what notes are there present.

5. colorcalibrose_hough is required to run to allow the colour differences between the 2 dollar (gold) and 
   5 cents (gray) as they share the same radius.
